        <img id="me" src="assets/images/image.jpg" alt="Lauren Abney">
        <p>Born and raised in Chattanooga, TN, Lauren attended the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga where she received
          a B.A. in Business Administration: Management and Marketing. She spent her last semester at the College of Charleston,
          earning a concentration in Arts Management.</p>
        <p>Lauren began her career at Chattanooga Ballet. As Assistant Director, she taught classes and workshops, managed a
          school of 300+ students and was instrumental in the staging of
          <i>The Nutcracker</i>, performed annually with the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera Orchestra for over 10,000 audience
          members.
        </p>
        <p>Looking for a change, Lauren left Chattanooga Ballet and began work as a Contract Specialist for MediTract. She quickly
          rose from her entry-level position to Operations and Sales Support Advisor, where she managed SalesForce for 75+
          active users and developed complex jobs and reports using SSMS, PowerBI and SSRS.</p>
        <p>After seven years with MediTract, Lauren felt constrained by the tools and systems in place and desparately wanted
          to create her own sites and applications.</p>
        <p>Hungry to learn more, Lauren recently relocated to Dallas, TX to attend a coding bootcamp at Southern Methodist University.
          She continues to do consulting work for MediTract. In her spare time, she loves to read and travel, and has recently
          taken an interest in boxing classes for fitness and learning to live a healthier lifestyle.</p>
