      <p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I'm Lauren Abney. Web Developer. SQL Analyst. Data Lover. Problem Solver. Creative Thinker.</p>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Tennesee at Chattanooga with my BS in Business Administration, with concentrations
        in General Management, Marketing &amp; Arts Management.</p>
      <p>I began my career with Chattanooga Ballet, working my way from Registrar up to Assistant Director before accepting an entry-level position with TractManager, Inc., a fast-growing software company in the healthcare industry.</p>
      <p>In my role at TractManager, I was able to observe gaps between people, processes and systems, and I was quickly drawn to technology as a way to bridge those gaps.  I became as proficient in Microsoft Excel and VBA as possible.  When it became too constraining, I moved on to teaching myself T-SQL.  Over my career at TractManager, I also taught myself Microsoft SSRS, SSIS and PowerBI.  I became certified as a Saleforce Advanced Administrator and Pardot Specialist and earned my Certificate in Healthcare Compliance.

      <p>At TractManager, I was always learning, always pushing myself &amp; always solving problems.  I implemented numerous systems, including Salesforce, Desk.com, Pardot, ChikPea and Ambition.  The real challenge - and fun - was integrating those systems with legacy systems.</p>
      <p>The projects I was most proud of during this time were developing a custom billing application utilizing Salesforce, Microsoft GP, T-SQL and SSRS that drastically improved quality, efficiency &amp; security of monthly client invoicing, and building a set of highly complex reports that aggregated and analyzed data across 600+ client databases to provide the company's first real picture of client health.</p>
      <p>In attempting to solve some of the more complex challenges I faced, I realized that SQL, Salesforce and reporting tools alone would not be enough.  I needed to be able to develop my own custom solutions.  After seven years with TractManager, I made a big leap.  I left the company, sold my house in Chattanooga, TN and moved to Dallas, TX to attend a full-stack web development program at Southern Methodist University.</p>
      <p>I recently graduated, adding the following skills to my toolkit:  JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, MySQL, Firebase, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, APIs, AJAX, JSON, Github, Heroku, Media Queries, Command Line and general computer science fundamentals.</p>
      <p>While attending the program, I continued to do consulting work for TractManager and I completed a 3-month stint with the American Heart Association as a Report Analyst.  After a little time off to travel, I'm eager to get back into a job where I can further my development skills and focus on my true passion - using data and design to solve problems.</p>
